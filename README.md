# calcAge
calcAge is simple script that takes a year, month, and day and determines how many years have passed since that date. The expected use is for calculating ages. I created it for filling in my age on my personal site :)

## Setup
The only configuration required is to set the ID of the HTML element, the year/month/day of birth, the flavour text that appears after the age and for the birthday celebration, and the fallback text to display if the script fails to complete.
```js
const ageElementId = "agehere";
const cakeElementId = "cakehere";
const birthYear = 1999;
const birthMonth = 9;
const birthDay = 16;
const ageFlavourText = [" years old"];
const cakeFlavourText = [" 🎉", " 🎂", " 🍰", " today!"];
const fallbackAgeText = "Born in " + birthYear;
const fallbackCakeText = " today!";
```
The flavour text is an array, so you can set a list of text to be randomly selected. It also works with just one item, so you don't need to have multiple entries.
The fallback text will completely overwrite the text inside element, so make sure to set this to something that you're happy to display if the calculation or random flavour text fails. Note that if the user doesn't have JavaScript enabled, this text will not set at all.

## Limitations
- The script has not been tested for uses outside of calculating the age of someone who has already been born. Other use cases may cause problems.
- The script also expects that the age will only show in one location on the page (element, not class).
- The script would need modifying to allow for dynamic pulling of year/month/day since it relies on static declarations.
- The script expects the age calculation and the birthday celebration elements to be next to each other in that order, to appear as "25 years old 🎉" for example.
